# Reinforcement-Learning
This repo contains different Policy based and Value based algorithms implemented using

## Algorithms

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming methods are used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. This repository includes implementations of dynamic programming algorithms such as:
- Value Iteration
- Policy Iteration

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
Deep Q-Network (DQN) is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks. This repository includes an implementation of DQN using the OpenAI Gym environment. The DQN algorithm is used to train agents to perform various tasks in different environments provided by OpenAI Gym.

## OpenAI Gym
OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It provides a variety of environments to test and benchmark the performance of RL algorithms. This repository utilizes OpenAI Gym environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented algorithms.

## Setting Up the Environment

To create a conda environment using the `environment.yml` file, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `environment.yml` file.
3. Run the following command to create the environment:
```sh
   conda env create -f environment.yml
```
